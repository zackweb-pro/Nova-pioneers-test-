# Space Exploration Learning Platform

## Project Overview
Our project is a web-based learning platform designed to educate users about space and exploration. The platform will use NASA APIs to provide real-time space-related content, track user progress through an XP-based system, and offer an interactive and engaging learning experience.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations.

### Backend:
- **Java & Spring Boot**: Using the MVC design pattern for structuring the backend logic.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and user management.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the primary database for storing user progress, XP, and other relevant data.

### APIs:
- **NASA APIs**: To fetch space-related data such as the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and other exploration-related information.

### Collaboration:
- **GitHub**: For version control and team collaboration.

## Features

1. **Landing Page**:
   - Displays NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).
