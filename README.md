# Space Exploration Learning Platform for Kids
## Project Overview
Our project is a kid-friendly web-based learning platform designed to educate young learners about space and exploration. The platform will use NASA APIs to provide real-time space-related content in an age-appropriate manner, track children's progress through a fun XP-based system, and offer an interactive and engaging learning experience with colorful visuals and simplified content.
